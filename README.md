# Week1
The evolution of electric vehicles highlights their potential to reshape the future of transportation. Here in Week1, I have used a dataset from kaggle on the topic to do data preprocessing and splitting. Further I will be focusing on building ML model.

# Week2
The dataset "IEA Global EV Data (2010-2024), is focused on supervised regression. But it contains more of strings categorical featured columns than numerical ones, which is why I will be using RandomForestRegressor model for the data. I have done Model Training and Evaluation for model prediction on it.
